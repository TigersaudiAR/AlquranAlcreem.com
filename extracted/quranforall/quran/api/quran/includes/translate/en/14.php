$t[10] = 'Their messengers said, &quot;Can there be doubt about Allah, Creator of the heavens and earth? He invites you that He may forgive you of your sins, and He delays your death for a specified term.&quot; They said, &quot;You are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping. So bring us a clear authority.&quot;';
$t[11] = 'Their messengers said to them, &quot;We are only men like you, but Allah confers favor upon whom He wills of His servants. It has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of Allah. And upon Allah let the believers rely.';

$t[22] = 'And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, &quot;Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with Allah] before. Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment.&quot;';

$t[34] = 'And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.';
