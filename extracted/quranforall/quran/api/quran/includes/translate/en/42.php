$t[13] = 'He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein.

Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative.';
$t[24] = 'Or do they say, &quot;He has invented about Allah a lie&quot;? But if Allah willed, He could seal over your heart. And Allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.';

$t[43] = 'And whoever is patient and forgives - indeed, that is of the matters [requiring] determination.';
$t[44] = 'And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no protector beyond Him. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, &quot;Is there for return [to the former world] any way?&quot;';
$t[45] = 'And you will see them being exposed to the Fire, humbled from humiliation, looking from [behind] a covert glance.
